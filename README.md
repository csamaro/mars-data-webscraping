## Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
Using BeautifulSoup I read each article title and its' respective teaser description on the Mars website into a dictionary.

## Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.
Using BeautifulSoup I read the data from the Mars weather table on the website.
Then, I converted the data into a dataframe so it would be easier to analyze and plot.
The dataframe was then exported into a csv file for future usage.

## Here are some interesting discoveries:
- On average, the third month has the coldest minimum temperature on Mars, and the eighth month is the warmest. But it is always very cold there in human terms!
- Atmospheric pressure is, on average, lowest in the sixth month and highest in the ninth.
- The distance from peak to peak is roughly 1425-750, or 675 days. A year on Mars appears to be about 675 days from the plot. Internet search confirms that a Mars year is equivalent to 687 earth days.
